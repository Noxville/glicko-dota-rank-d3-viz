# glicko-dota-rank-d3-viz
Small data collection for Glicko 2 ratings, and a D3 visualization for ranks for teams.

Glicko 2 ratings are taken from [datdota](https://www.datdota.com/ratings/), a site I run. Some filtering on non-EU teams for my purposes, and some fugdging for teams which have dropped off the rating list.

D3 part is taken and edited from [Cale Tilfordâ€™s](https://bl.ocks.org/tlfrd/1eaaf63bf8110247a6ff88cd5601a9b7) snippet, which in turn is inspired by [Nadieh Bremer's original work](http://bl.ocks.org/nbremer/0324ec7eb18f64ac0ce1b294126f1c6c).
